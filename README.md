# Summer-2022-SWE-Project

Come view our site!

https://adventmovies.online/


Our movie review website will allow any U.S. based user to create a free account to read, comment/rank other film reviews, 
and add their own reviews to the website. We will then use a novel ranking system to show which comments are popularized the most 
by users on the platform. By creating this website, our aim would be to democratize the movie review system and give people a place to openly 
express how they felt about a film and what it meant to them. This will also allow people to save time by avoiding films that have generally been 
unpopular and bring more conversation, and potentially discourse surrounding films that have profound underlying meaning or social implications.
